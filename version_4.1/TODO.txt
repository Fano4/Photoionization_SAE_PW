Fix the bug related to the method index. The method index must correspond to a particular method to work correctly. for instance, if there is a HF followed by two MULTI, method[0] would for now be HF, and method[1] would be MULTI. We have to number the different methods independently. method[casscf[0]]= first multi and mathod[casscf[1]] = second multi. This ensures we read correctly.

Change the implementation of the radial overlap integral. The hypergeometric is really not accurate and quite unstable with respect to evaluatinggaussian functions. The hypergeometric can be written as a linear comnbination of gaussian functions * polynomials.

Fix the bug related to the different ways of requiring multi-states in casscf. For now, the code is configured so that the wf statements and the state card are on the same single ling, separated by semi-columns. It is also possible that one write them on different lines. need to adapt for this
